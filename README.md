# M1 Project | HELP! CSS

## Introduction

Dear Mr. Flash I'm Clara S. Smith I heard you are the fastest runner on earth. Maybe you can help me realizing my dream and overcome my biggest weakness.

My biggest weakness is in fact CSS. It would be amazing if you could explain me CSS in the fastest time possible, so I can make CSS my best friend and also become the best Frontend-Developer-version of myself.

To help me you have to jump into the solution box of that showed css style, which you can see on my monitor. Sometimes you can also see the second monitor with the beloging HTML5 DOM. The boxes the you have to collide into are flying on top of you.

The more right boxes you hit the higher your score gets and the more I understand CSS.

With the left arrow you run to the left side, with the right arrow you run to the right side and with the up arrow or with the spacebar you can jump up high to hit the right solution box.

PLEASE!!! Mr. Flash I beg you to help me.
